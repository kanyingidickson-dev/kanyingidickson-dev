# Hi 👋, I'm Kanyingidickson

I’m a **Full-Stack Architect & AI/ML Engineer**. I build scalable, high-performance web platforms and design intelligent systems powered by machine learning and LLMs. From ideation to production, I thrive at the intersection of **clean architecture, cutting-edge AI, and deployable systems**. Whether it’s building a real-time SaaS product or evaluating LLM prompts for enterprise use, I focus on **robust, maintainable, and scalable solutions**.
