# Hi, I'm Kanyingidickson – Full-Stack Architect & Engineer 👋

**I build and scale web platforms** with a focus on high-performance, secure code. I specialize in taking concepts from ideation to production, with a strong emphasis on **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **solid Python backends**. If it needs clean architecture and reliable deployment, I’m on it.

### 🛠️ The Stack (What I use to ship)
**Frontend:** Next.js (Server Components) • TypeScript • React • Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js (Express) • Python (Django/FastAPI) • REST/GraphQL APIs  
**Data:** PostgreSQL • MongoDB (I choose the right tool for the job)  
**Ops/Deployment:** CI/CD (GitHub Actions) • Docker • Cloud (AWS/Vercel)

### 📈 My Focus
I thrive on **Greenfield Architecture** and **System Refactoring**. Whether you need someone to design a system from scratch or refactor an existing one for scalability and performance, I’ve got you covered. 

Currently open to **freelance** and **full-time** opportunities. Let’s build something great together!

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
